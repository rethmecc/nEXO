Taking too long to read large hdf5 files.
This is probably due to the current method of searching for each waveform.
Learning hdf5 in order to solve this issue.
Processed data. Data doesn't look good. Baseline keeps shifting, causing the peak finder to fail. Also, dark noise is quite high even at -100C (radioactivity?).
Upgrading peak finder to calculate local baseline (one peak width) as it scans the histogram for peaks.
Paul will retake data.
Fabrice suggests that problem may be caused by one of the four MPPCs being bad. Will switch to a different one.
WF on scope looks much better. Taking full dataset.
Constructed box ot of alimunum to protect reference MPPC.

Data from yesterday still looks bad.
Created algorithm to count zeros using the minimum of the WF.
