\paragraph{Abstract}\hspace{0.5cm}\\
  
  Founded in 1968 and located on the campus of UBC \footnote{University of British Columbia}, TRIUMF \footnote{Canada's national laboratory 
  for particle and nuclear physics} is one of the world’s leading subatomic physics laboratories. Different research experiments in particle physics
  are conducted. On the microscopic scale TRIUMF and nEXO \footnote{next generation Enriched Xenon Observatory} work together to measure 
  the neutrino-less double beta decay. 
  \\
  \ce{^{136}Xe} may produce such decay, emitting light at 175 nm. My internship focuses on the characterisation of Silicum Photo-Multipliers which will be 
  used to detect this light in the nEXO experiment. To characterize them, efficiency dark noise and cross-talk were calculated
  at different over-voltages. Each SiPM has its own breakdown voltage beyond photons could be detected. 
  \\
  We characterized both MEG MPPC \footnote{SiPMs produced by Hammamatsu} and VUV3 SiPM at $-100^\circ$C. With an overvoltage of 3.5V for the MEG MPPC (breakdown 
  voltage of 57V at such temperature) and 11V (breakdown voltage of 44.7V at such temperature), the efficiency, the dark noise and the crosstalk were plotted.

   \\
   Si l'\'el\'ement chimique \ce{^{136}Xe} est un candidat potentiel pour produire une telle d\'esint\'egration avec \'emission de lumi\`ere \`a 175 nm, le but de mon

   (photons) \'emise. Ainsi il est possible de les caract\'eriser en calculant l'efficacit\'e, le bruit noire et le crosstalk à diff\'erentes tensions de polarisation. 
   Chaque SiPM a sa propre tension à partir de laquelle un photon est d\'etect\'e. 
   \\
   Le MEG MPPC ansi que le VUV3 SiPm ont \'et\'e caract\'eris\'e \`a $-100^\circ$C. Avec une suretension de 3.5V pour le MEG MPPC (La tension de rupture est

%The strategic plan of TRIUMF could be divided in three main parts :

%\item The understanding of the building blocks od matter and how they shape our universe.

%SNOLAB’s ultra-low background places it centre stage in two quests: on the cosmic scale for interstellar dark matter and on the microscopic scale for neutrinoless double-beta decay. Astrophysical measurements indicate that 80% of the matter in the universe is “missing,” that is, we can see its gravitational effects but it does not emit any heat or light. This “dark matter” is hypothesized to be the stuff that shapes the destiny of the universe, and yet we have no idea what it really is.

%Experiments at SNOLAB will search for hypothesized rare interactions between dark matter and normal matter. On the microscopic end of the spectrum, neutrinoless double beta decay probes the very nature of antimatter. Advanced theories of particle physics and the Big Bang suggest that the neutrino particle may have a special nature: it might be its own antiparticle. Answering this question about the neutrino could reveal new insights into why the modern universe is predominantly occupied by matter (including dark matter!) rather than anti-matter.

%The initial program of SNOLAB will likely include experiments that focus on direct detection of dark matter (DEAP/CLEAN, PICASSO, Super-CDMS) and neutrinoless double-beta decay (SNO+, EXO).

  
  
  
  


The subject is this internship which dealed with/talked about the developpement of the photo-detector for the nEXO experiment, 
covers both fast electronics reading, programmation and knowledges in physics let me to interpretate the results.
\\
The reader could find any appendix to go deeper in understanding of the subject.
\\

  This last internship of 3 months lets students of the Master PSA from the University of Strasbourg to apply what they have learned 6 months before. 
  The goal of this internship was to show that the student can conduct a research experiment with responsibility and autonominity. 
  In that way the student may be ready to continue by doing a PhD. 
  \\
  
  Founded in 1968 and located on the campus of the University of British Columbia,TRIUMF is one of the world’s leading subatomic physics laboratories 
  and the first national laboratory in Canada. The main feature of this laboratory is a cyclotron which was built in 1971. 
  While maintaining ties to the research programs among the 19 different member unversities from across Canada, this large community, composed of 
  international teams of scientists, post-doctoral fellow and students, has expanded from nuclear physics 
  to particle physics, molecular and materials science, and nuclear medicine.
  \\
  
  Among the particle physcics collaboration hosted by TRIUMF is nEXO, whose goal is to search for evidence of the theoritical 
  neutrino-less double beta decay \(0\Pneutrino\beta\beta\). The standard model predicts the ordinary double beta decay \(2\Pneutrino\beta\beta\). The 
  detection of \(0\Pneutrino\beta\beta\) would validate ``Physics beyond the standard model'', show that the neutrino is a Majorana particle and 
  give a measure of the absolute neutrino mass. 
  \\
  
  \ce{^{136}Xe} is one of the 35 natural isotopes capable of \(2\Pneutrino\beta\beta\). If \(0\Pneutrino\beta\beta\) is possibleot would occur in \ce{^{136}Xe} 
  according to this reaction : 
    
  \begin{equation}
    \ce{^{136}Xe} \rightarrow \ce{^{136}Ba} + 2\Pelectron %\iff 2\Pneutron \rightarrow 2\Pproton + 2\Pelectron \iff \ce{^{136}Xe} \rightarrow 2\APneutrino + 2\Pelectron 
  \end{equation}
   
  The two electrons, which are ejected with high kinetic energy, scatter off the electrons of other \ce{^{136}Xe} atoms. If so, one of the impacted \ce{^{136}Xe}
  atoms is excited from the ground state and then de-energizes by releasing photons. This is knowen as scintillation. The wavelength of the created light is 175 nm. 
  \\
  
  So nEXO is currently being designed to use 5 tons of enriched liquid Xenon contained in a barrel. The wall of this barrel is covered with SiPM detectors. 
  \footnote{Silicum Photo-Multiplier.}
  \\  
  The goal of my research internship is to indentify suitable SiPMs for nEXO by testing devices from several manufacturers. In 2014 a test setup 
  was built: a box divided in two parts. The first part contains a \xfl which sends photons to the surface of two SiPM detectors. The signals are observed 
  on the screen of an oscilloscope, which is monitored by a computer to register and store waveforms. An algorithm (C++ and root) lets us characterize the SiPMs.
  \\
  
  So the question is to know if the selected SiPM could fufill all the experiment's requirements: achieve efficiency \(\geq\)15\% at 175nm (the wavelength 
  of Xenon scintillation), achieve dark noise rate less than 50Hz/mm\texttwosuperior{} and limit the number of correlated pulses (cross-talk and after-pulse)  
  to less than 0.02 per parent pulse.
  
  If the first part will describe briefly the nEXO experiment and remind the reader how  a SiPM works, the second part will give more details about the setup 
  and the algorithm. This would allow the results in the third part to be understood.

  nEXO is the little sister of the EXO-200 experiment. They both have the goal of observing the \(0\Pneutrino\beta\beta\). More information are available on the the appendix ~\ref{app:nEXO}. 
  
 \paragraph{\underline{\emph{EXO-200.}}}\hspace{0.5cm}\\

  EXO currently has a 200-kilogram of liquid Xenon containing in a copper cylindrical time projection chamber whose extremities are covered by APDs 
  \footnote{Avalanche photodiodes.}. Xenon double beta decay \(2\Pneutrino\beta\beta\) \footnote{In August 2011, EXO-200 was the first experiment to 
  observe double beta decay of \ce{^{136}Xe}, with a half life of \(2.11^1021\)years.} was detected, and life time limits have been set for 
  \(0\Pneutrino\beta\beta\). However, the background radiation is a significant problem. 
  \\
  The \(0\Pneutrino\beta\beta\) would appear as a narrow spike in the energy spectrum around the Xenon Q-value (Qββ = 2457.8 keV). 

  Energy resolution is a key parameter in identifying \(0\Pneutrino\beta\beta\) decays. Even if the gamma background can be rejected by 
  selecting an energy region around 2.48 MeV, the EXO experiment is already limiting the energy resolution because of the low gain of APDs. 
  EXO-200 must be improved by nEXO. 
  
  \paragraph{\underline{\emph{nEXO.}}}\hspace{0.5cm}\\
  
  The nEXO experiment is just a bigger EXO experiment since the barrel will be expanded to contain 5 tonnes of Xenon. Moreover since the gain of a 
  SiPM is a factor of \(10^4\) greater than that of an APD (~200), the APds will be subsituted by SiPMs which will cover the wall of that barrel. 
  
  \section{SiPM.}\label{sec:SiPM}
  
  Silicon photomultiplier (SiPM) is a photodetector with single-photon detection capability. This device consists of a monolithic array of 
  single avalanche photodiode \footnote{APD} pixels.  
  \\
  Each pixel produces a pulse of constant amplitude regardless of the number of impinging photons. All pixels are connected to the same output channel. 
  The total output signal is equal to the sum of those from the indidividual pixels.
  SiPM offers good properties like high gain \(10^6 - 10^7\) and sensitivity, and very good time (ns) and photon-counting (nm) resolutions. 
  \\ 
  One feature of the SiPM is that it operates in Geiger mode.
  
  \subsection{APD's operation.}
  
  This short section is to remind the reader of an APD's operating.
  \\ 
  A reverse voltage is applied to the APD (which is a PN junction): this is the Geiger mode. When the light enters a photodiode, and if the light energy is 
  higher than the band gap energy, electron-hole pairs are generated in the depletion layer (p-). Then, because of an electric field created by the reverse voltage,
  the electrons drift toward the n++ side, and the holes toward the p++ side of the PN junction: this is the avalanche phenomen. 
  \\  
  With a higher electric field one avalanche can itself trigger a second avalanche at a different position. In Geiger mode this new situation is due to
  the holes which can trigger other avalanches \cite{ref:}  
  \\
  The avalanche is limited by the buildup of a limiting space charge in the depletion layer (p-) which decreases the field. Moreover, since the photodetector 
  has a resistor (quenching resistor) in series, when the avalanche current flows through the resistor, the biased voltage applied to the junction drops below the breakdown voltage. 
  This quenches the avalanche; thus, the current decreases to zero, and the voltage across the p-n junction increases again above breakdown voltage.
  The pixel is then ready to detect the arrival of a new photon.   
  
  \begin{figure}[!hbtp]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[trim=1.5cm 2cm 5.5cm 3cm, clip=true,totalheight=.4\textwidth]{Pictures/blabla/PN_junction.jpg}%trim=10cm 4cm 1cm 12cm, clip=true, 
  \caption{Details of a pixel of a SiPM.}
  \label{fig:PN_junction}
  \end{figure}
  
  Such ideal picture is strongly modified by the occurrence of phenomena leading to dark current, afterpulsing effects and crootalk.   
  
  \subsection{The three issues of operating SiPM.} 
  
  \paragraph{\underline{\emph{Dark Noise.}}}
  One of the main source of noise limiting the SiPM performance is the dark noise rate, which mainly originates from the electron created thermally in the 
  depletion layer (p-). These carriers trigger avalanches exactly as if the pixel would have been fired.
  \\
  The probability that dark noise occurs decreases with the temperature (See section 4.2).  
  
  \paragraph{\underline{\emph{Trapping phenomena: Afterpulsing.}}}

  Traps may result from damage caused by an implantation of some impurities in the fabrication process. In the depletion layer, deep levels trap some avalanche carriers and release them with 
  a statistical delay. If the delay is greater than the dead time after the previous avalanche pulse, a released carrier can
  re-trigger an avalanche and cause a statistically correlated pulse. These delayed corrolated pulses are known as afterpulse. 
  \\
  The probability that an afterpulse occurs increases with increasing bias voltage. 
  
  \paragraph{\underline{\emph{Crosstalk.}}}

  Hot carriers in avalanche p-n junction emit photons even in the visible range. Thus, during the avalanche breakdown, a photodiode operating in Geiger mode
  may emit a few photons. The photons emitted will be detected by neighboring pixels despite an optical wall between two pixels. 
  \\
  The picture below demonstrates these three main issues:

  \caption{An aluminium box contains a \xfl and two photodetectors.}
  \label{fig:DN_AP_CT}
  \end{figure}
  
  \section{The \xfl and the MEG.}
  
  \paragraph{\underline{\emph{\xfl}}}
 
  A Hamamatsu L11035-03-21 Xenon flash lamp module was utilized as a light source in a nitrogen-filled, light-tight box to simulate the ultraviolet 
  conditions of the future experiment. 
  The amount of light hitting the photodetectors was managed by a square wave pulse generator, otherwise saturation of the signal from the 
  photodetectors occurs. 
  \\
  To control light output, and thus the number of photons reaching the photodetectors, we could move out the lamp away from the surface of the detector since intensity of 
  light drops off as one over distance suqarred. We could also set the voltage discharge on the lamp by adding an external voltage supply line. 
  \\
  
  For all our measurments, the position of the lamp and the external voltage were set at 20 mm from the metal divider of the box and at 2.8 V, respectively.
  Then the light was collimated by a 5 mm hole, filtered, and then interacts with a beam splitter (BS). The beam splitter separated the incoming beam into two 
  equal beams which reached the surface of each photodetector at the same time. 
  \\
  
  The \xfl emits a spectrum of light in visible-light visible regions. A filter select the 175 nm wavelength (UV region). This filter also attenuated the light of the \xfl by 20\%. Then two other 
  identical filters were added to provide additional attenuations (the light reaching the photo-detectors was still too intense). 
  \\
  
  As photons of this wavelength have an attenuation length of only a few mm, the box was filled with N2 gas. 
   
  %According to the data sheet of the \xfl the pulse last ~ 800 ns. that why the pulse shape last 700 ns, same. In fact it is the same plot but invert. 
  %filter atteneuate 20 percent of amplitude. no effect on the duration of the pulse. the volatge of the SiPM increase the amplitude but not the duration. 
  
  Moreover light leaks appeared when the \xfl was operating. They can hinder and negate the results of data collection. Two kinds of light leaks have been observed :
  \begin{itemize}
   \item Visible light leaks can impact the surface of the photodetectors. So the efficiencies for the SiPMs and MPPCs being tested at 175 nm would be invalide. 
   The solution has been to cover the \xfl with a black box. Moreover the interior walls of the light-tight box were covered in matt black viny to absorbe these
   light leaks.
   \item Radiofrequency light leaks result in electromagnetic noise on the signals from the detectors. 
  \end{itemize}  

  Radiofrequency noise occured when the \xfl was triggered by a square wave pulse generator. We noticed that too much readiofrequency noise disturbed the signals of the two detectors. It was not 
  possible to identify pulses from photons because they were lost in that noise. 
  \\

  Once the sources of noise were identified it was possible to modify the setup to remove the noise. 
  
  \section{Sources of electromagnetic noise}
  
  The noise we observed came from electromagnetic sources. We noticed that: 

  \begin{itemize}
  \item Some devices were not grounded. The consequence was that we were able to observe some oscillations on the oscilloscope
  ~\ref{fig:signal_with_noise}.
  \item When the \xfl was working it was creating some radio waves propagating through the air and which were then transmitted to any piece of conductive metal of the 
  box. The consequences were : 
    \begin{itemize}
    \item The aluminium lid of the box conducted everywhere the electric field of these radio waves, which disturbed the amplifiers.
    \item Each detector could feel these radio waves and the signal got worst.
    \item The metal divider acted as a transmitter and the piece of metal of the signal wires connected to the amplifiers acted as antenna.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
  
  \section{Three main solutions.}
  
  The first solution was to create a ground point on which all devices - especially the square wave pulse generator - were connected with the same wire 
  (to avoid ground loops). In that way, the oscillations of ~\ref{fig:comparaison} were removed. 
  
  \paragraph{\underline{\emph{Isolate the lid from the box.}}}
  
  As it was described above, the electric field from the radio waves propagates through the entire lid. When the box was closed it disturbed the working 
  amplifiers. The solution was to isolate the lid from the box by adding black tape and to guide the electric field with copper on the edge of the lid
  to the ground point.

  \paragraph{\underline{\emph{Isolate the \xfl.}}}
  
  As the \xfl creates radio waves, we decided to isolate it by building a faraday cage around it. We added a thick piece of metal to absorb radio waves 
  and we covered this first part of the box with aluminium foil. In that way the electric field propagates through the aluminium foil to the edge of the top
  box to the ground point. 

  \paragraph{\underline{\emph{Isolate the photo-detectors and the amplifiers.}}}
  
  As the bottom and the top detector seems to capture radio waves, two faraday cages were created to protect them.
  
  This picture below could summarize our work (yellow signal is the bottom photodetector and the blue one is on the top):

  A SiPM, placed on the top, was used as a reference. It let us check if the light remained constant when we characterized a MEG MPPC and a VUV3 SiPM at 
  $-100^\circ$C. 
   
  \section{MEG.}
  
  Like the SiPM \footnote{See above section SiPM.} the MPPC is a type of photon counting device made up of multiple 
  APD pixels operated in Geiger mode. The manufacturing of those pixels is shown in section \ref{sec:SiPM}. 
  The output current caused by Geiger 
  discharge (due to the detection of photons) is a pulse waveform with a sharp rise time. The output current when Geiger 
  discharge is halted by the quenching resistor is a pulse waveform with a relatively slow fall time.  
  \\
  The pictures below show a single photon pulse shape and also expand the rise time and the fall time.

   %\paragraph{principe of operating}
  %This short paragraph will remind the reader what is the principe of operating of MPPPC/APD. 
  
  %When the light (both particle and wave) level becomes extremely low, light behaves as discrete particles (photons) allowing us to count the number of 
 %% photons. The MPPC is suitable for photon counting since it offers an excellent time resolution and a multiplication function having a high gain and 
 % low noise. Photon counting delivers a higher S/N and higher stability even in measurements at very low light levels.
  
 % When an APD is operated at a reverse voltage higher (Geiger mode) than the breakdown voltage, a saturated output inherent to the APD device occurs (Geiger discharge)
 % by input of light. 

 % Geiger mode allows obtaining a large output by way of discharge even when detecting a single photon. 
 % Once Geiger discharge begins, it continues for as long as the electric fi eld in the APD is maintained.
  
  %To halt a Geiger discharge and detect the next photon, an external circuit outside the APD must lower the operating voltage. One specific example for 
 % halting the Geiger discharge is a technique using a so-called quenching resistor connected in series with the APD \footnote(see picture). 
  
 % This quickly stops avalanche multiplication in the APD because a drop in the operating voltage occurs when the output current caused by the Geiger 
 % discharge flows in the quenching resistor. 
  
 % The output current caused by Geiger discharge is a pulse waveform with a sharp rise time (tipical 20 ns). 
 % (while) The output current when Geiger discharge is halted by the quenching resistor is a pulse waveform with a relatively slow fall time (typical 75 ns).

 % The MPPC structure is shown in the following figure. The basic element (pixel) of an MPPC is a combination of the Geiger mode APD and quenching resistor, 
 % and a large number of these pixels are electrically connected and arranged in two dimensions
  
 % basic operation : 
  
%  Each pixel in the MPPC outputs a pulse at the same amplitude when it detects a photon. 
  
 % Pulses generated by multiple pixels are output while superimposed onto each other. 
 % 
%  For example, if four photons are incident on different pixels and detected at the same time, then the MPPC outputs a signal whose amplitude equals 
 % the height of the four superimposed pulses. 
  
%  Each pixel outputs only one pulse and this does not vary with the number of incident photons. 
  
%  So the number of output pulses is always one regardless of whether one photon or two or more photons enter a pixel at the same time. 
  
  %This means that MPPC output linearity gets worse as more photons are incident on the MPPC such as when two or more photons enter one
  %pixel. This makes it essential to select an MPPC having enough pixels to match the number of incident photons
  
  
  
  %For the MPPC readout circuit, a current-to-voltage amplifier can be used as with previous semiconductor devices. The MPPC outputs high-speed pulse 
  %signals, but because the gain of the MPPC itself is high, there is no need to greatly increase the gain on the circuit side. 
  %This has an advantage that there is more freedom in circuit design.

  The observed waveform lets us calculate the efficiency, the dark noise, the cross talk. These 4 results characterize two different photodetectors from 
  Hammamatsu: a MEG MPPC and a VUV3 SiPM.  

  
  \section{The PDE.}
  %region or side
  A simple way to calculate the efficiency is to define two regions in the scope. The ``dark region'' is the time before the \xfl triggers 
  and the light region is the time immidiately after the flash lamp triggers. 
  \\
  The both regions had the same size - 3ms \footnote{Time base is 1ms/div} each - to allow for easy comparison and pulse from dark noise  can appear anywhere in these regions: 
  
  \begin{figure}[!hbtp]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[totalheight=0.22\textwidth,trim=0cm 6.5cm 0cm 0cm, clip=true]{Pictures/blabla/light_region_3.png}
  \centering{\caption{Dark and light regions.}}
  \label{fig:dark_light_region}
  \end{figure}
  
  So the average efficiency - \(<PE>\) - of a detector is defined with this relation below: 
  \\
  
  The probability of observing zero photon in the ``light region`` is : 
  
  \begin{equation}
    P_{L0} = \frac{N_{L0}}{N_{tot}} \textrm{,}   
  \end{equation}
  
  The probability of observing zero photon in the ''dark region`` is : 
  \begin{equation}
    P_{D0} = \frac{N_{D0}}{N_{tot}} \textrm{ ,}
  \end{equation}
  
  \(N_{L0}\) is the number of times where zero photons were absorbed in the light region, \(N_{D0}\) is the same in the dark region. 
  \(N_{tot}\) is the total number of events. 
  
  The probability of obtaining zero dark noise \(P_{DN0}\) and the probability of obtaining zero photo electron from the lamp \(P_{Lamp0}\)
  follow a Poisson distribution. These two probabilities are linked by the probability \(P_{L0}\): 
  
  \begin{equation}
    P_{L0} = P_{Lamp0}.P_{DN0} \textrm{, where } P_{Lamp0} = \mathrm{e}^{-<PE>} \textrm{ and } P_{DN0} = \mathrm{e}^{-DN}
  \end{equation}
  \begin{equation}
    \textrm{So : } \mathrm{e}^{-<PE>} =\frac{P_{L0}}{P_{D0}}
  \end{equation}
  
  \begin{equation}
    <PE> =  -ln(\frac{P_{L0}}{P_{D0}}).
  \end{equation}
  \\
  
  To determinate the number of ``zero'' an algorithm was designed:
  \\
  1. Smooth a waveform to reduce the Gaussian noise and therefore to increase the signal to noise ratio. 
  \\
  2. Set a threshold at 3.5 times the baseline \(\sigma\). 
  \\
  3. Record all pulses above the threshold.
  \\
  4. Record pulsewidth and charge for next step in analysing.
  \\
  
  To have good statistics we repeated this process for 15000 waveforms. 
  \\
  Then we ploted the related histogram and used it to determinate the number of ``zero'' PE (0PE), one PE (1PE which corresponds to te detection of one photo electron
  or one after-pulse since they have the same shape), two PEs (2PE which corresponds to the detection of two photo electrons or one cross-talk for the 
  same reason) etc:
  \\
  Here is one of our results for the MEG MPPC at $-100^\circ$C with an overvoltage of 58.5V (At such temperature the breakdown voltage is 57V): 
  (from right to left peaks match respectively with 0PE, 1PE, 2PE ...)  
  
  \begin{figure}[!hbtp]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[totalheight=0.4\textwidth,trim=1.8cm 1cm 5.5cm 2.5cm, clip=true]{Pictures/Pictures_MEG/histo.png}
  \centering{\caption{Histogram of MEG MPPC for an overvoltage of 58.2V @ $-100^\circ$C.}}
  \label{fig:histo}
  \end{figure}
  
  From all of the histograms it is now possible to plot the efficiency (\(<PE>\)). The efficiency is relative (\(<PE>\)) because we did not use the 
  photodetector on the top to check if the light is constant. According to some documentations \cite{ref:SiPM} the shape of the curve is what we expected. 
  The VUV3 SiPM has a better efficiency than the MEG MPPC:
  
  \begin{figure}[!hbtp]

  \centering{\caption{Efficiency of the VUV3 SiPM (red) and of the MEG MPPC (blue).}}
  \label{fig:efficiency}
  \end{figure}
      
  \section{Dark Noise.}
  
  The dark noise -DN- follows also a Poisson law :
  
  \begin{equation}
    P_{D0} =  exp(-<DN>) \iff <DN> = -ln(P_{D0}).
  \end{equation}
  
  To plot the dark noise, all of the previous histograms are used. Here is our results for the MEG MPPC:
  
  \begin{figure}[!hbtp]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[totalheight=0.4\textwidth,trim=1.8cm 1cm 5.5cm 3cm, clip=true]{Pictures/Pictures_MEG/DN.png}
  \centering{\caption{light region.}}
  \label{fig:pulse_shape}
  \end{figure}
  
  The dark noise decrease with the temperature as expected. 
  
  \section{Cross-Talk.}

  To plot cross-talk, all the previous histograms are used. We integrate the 1PE peak divided by the sum of the rest of the histogram execpt 0PE. 
  Here is our results for the two photodetectors:
  
  \begin{figure}[!hbtp]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[totalheight=0.4\textwidth,trim=1.8cm 1cm 5.5cm 3cm, clip=true]{Pictures/Pictures_MEG/CT.png}
  \centering{\caption{Crosstalk for the VUV3 SiPM (red) and for the MEG MPPC (blue).}}
  \label{fig:CT}
  \end{figure}
  
  The crosstalk is less important for the VUV3 SiPM than for the MEG MPPC. The VUV3 SiPM seems to be a good candidat for nEXO.

\chapter{Conclusion}
  
  The electromagnetic noise was a real issue for taking data from the oscilloscope. 
  Once the issue was solved, my co worker and I spend three long days of 
  for taking data of different SiPMs. But we could only plot data from the MEG MPPC and from the VUV3 SiPM. 
  The range of the overvoltage of the MEG MPPC was not so large as expected. The saturation of the amplifier was responsible of this issue. 
  \\
  
  Moreover the algorithm to calculate after pulse seemed not to work properly. That is way it was not possible to show results about afterpulsing.
  \\
  
  The oral presentation lets me show more interesting results.

\chapter{The nEXO experiement}\label{app:nEXO}
  
  
  \section{the neutrinoless double beta decay : \(0\Pneutrino\beta\beta\)}
  
  \paragraph{\underline{\emph{History.}}}
  
  If this reference \cite{ref:wikipedia_beta} could give more details about the \(0\Pneutrino\beta\beta\), the double beta decay, which can proceed without 
  emission of any neutrino, was discovered by W. H. Furry in 1939. 

  \paragraph{\underline{\emph{Majorana particle and leptonic number violation.}}}
  
  To explain the \(0\Pneutrino\beta\beta\), lets start by reminding the double \(2\Pneutrino\beta\beta\) according the Standard Model. 
  As two neutrons become in two protons, the conservation of the charge implies the creation of two electrons \ref{eq:charge}. As 2 electrons appear, 
  the conservation of the leptonic electronic number implies the creation of two anti-neutrino \ref{eq:leptonic}:  
  
  \begin{equation} \label{eq:charge}
    (A,Z) \rightarrow (A,Z+2) + 2\Pelectron + 2\APneutrino
  \end{equation}
  leptonic electronic conservation :
  \begin{equation} \label{eq:leptonic}
    0 \rightarrow 0 + 2*(+1) + 2*(-1)
  \end{equation}
  
  Now lets consider the case when neutrinos are Majorana particles \footnote{ In opposition of Dirac particles where particles are distinct from anti-particles.}
  which means particles and anti-particles are identical except for their helicities. If so switching the helicity in this way allows 
  a particle in one frame of reference to be an anti-particle in another.
  \\
  That means that the emitted anti-neutrinos is neutrinos which conducts to the equation :
  
  \begin{equation}
    (A,Z) \rightarrow (A,Z+2) + 2\Pelectron + 2\Pneutrino
  \end{equation}
  
  Here we can observe the lepton number violation which would be an observation of ``Physics beyond the standard model'' :
  
  \begin{equation}
    0 \rightarrow 0 + 2*(+1) + 2*(+1)
  \end{equation}
  
  The Feyman diagrams related to \(2\Pneutrino\beta\beta\) and \(0\Pneutrino\beta\beta\) would be \cite{ref:beta_decay}: 
  
  \begin{figure}[!hbtp]

  \label{fig:feyman}
  \end{figure}
  
  \paragraph{\underline{\emph{The  measurement of the neutrino mass}}}
  If neutrinoless double beta decay were observed, it would also provide a measurement of the neutrino mass, since the rate of neutrinoless double beta 
  decay is related to the square of the neutrino mass :

  \section{The nEXO experiment}

  The \(2\Pneutrino\beta\beta\) or the  \(0\Pneutrino\beta\beta\) releases two electrons with a high energy (kinetic energy).   
  The \ce{^{136}Xe} is then in an existed state. It relaxes by releasing a photon. 
 
  Then the relased photon enters inside a SiPM. The photoelectric effect happens and the avalanche process begins. 
  \\
  
  The nEXO experiment consist in a big barrel whose walls are covered by SiPMs. This barrel will be filled with 5 tonnes of Xe liquid :

  will saturatebeing tested is critical to receiving good data. The measurements
  being taken rely on observing a maximum of one photon over a given time
  interval that is determined by the response of individual detectors. For instance, a
  particular silicon photomultiplier (SiPM) may respond to a single photon with a
  pulse that spans 700 ns. In this scenario, the SiPM must not receive more light
  than the case where one photon every 700 ns is observed, otherwise saturation of
  the signal occurs and good data cannot be acquired. Figure 1 illustrates an
  acceptable signal, and a saturated signal, for one of the SiPMs to be tested. As a
  2result of this light output requirement, the Xenon flash lamp must be
  commissioned to only allow a limited amount of light into the system.

  The simplest method for controlling light output for the system is through
  movement. Intensity of light drops off as one over distance squared, and thus
  motion of the lamp will affect the number of photons hitting the detectors.
  Control over the flash lamp location is provided by a rod attached to the lamp
  mount and extending out of the box through a port. In the test set-up, this allows
  for approximately a 20 cm range of movement to and from the photodetector
  candidates. A simple comparison between lamp positions found that this motion
  can change the light output by a factor of four.

  he effect of using filters in the set-up was tested with filters from eSource
  Optics, Pelham Research Optical, and THORlabs by comparing the charge build-
  up on a reference multipixel photon counter (MPPC) and a photo multiplier tube
  (PMT) with the flash lamp light being both filtered and unfiltered. 4,5,6 The results
  are presented below in Table 1. Overall, no significant difference was found
  between the UV filters' transmission; the UV filters from Pelham and the UV
  filter from eSource all resulted in similar charge-build up, reducing the charge
  received by the MPPC and PMT by a factor of 10 000. As a contrast, the visible-
  4range filter reduced the charge by a factor of 100. This is an expected result, due
  to the spectrum of the lamp peaking around 400 nm.

  The L9455 and L9456 are compact xenon flash lamp modules integrating a 5-watt xenon flash lamp with its power supply and trigger socket.
  These lamp modules allow an energy input up to 5 watts, which is the maximum among similar lamp modules of the same size

\chapter{Few details about SiPM}\label{app:SiPM}

  APDs (Avalanche Photodiodes) are high-speed, high sensitivity photodiodes utilizing an internal gain mechanisme that function as reverse voltage. 
  
  Passive quenching : The avalanche photodiode (i.e. each pixel for the silicon photomultiplier) is
connected to the power supply through a large series resistor R s ( R s ≈ 100 − 400kΩ accord-
ing the manufacturer). If the current through the diode equals zero, the voltage across the diode
equals U bias , which is larger than the breakdown voltage. If the diode breaks down, the series
resistor reduces the voltage across the APD, what quenches the avalanche. After the breakdown is
quenched, the diode is recharged through the resistor. A drawback of passive quenching is then the
slow recharge of APD.

  During an avalanche, only a very small fraction of the trapping level is filled : therefore, the trap population is always well below saturation and 
  the carrier trapping probability remains constant during all the avalanche pulse. 
  
  Each electron-hole recombination mechanism can be reverse leading to a carrier generation. Recombination holds when excess carriers decay. 
  Generation takes place when there is a paucity of carriers. We can distinguish three ways of recombination. 
  
  ∗ Band-to-band recombination or radiative recombination : electron-hole pairs recombine directly from band to band with the energy carried away by photons.
  An electron falls from its state in the conduction band into the empty state in the valence band which is associated with the hole. Its counterpart is the 
  optical electron-hole pairs generation.
  
  ∗ Trap assisted recombination, also called Shockley Read Hall effect: electron-hole pairs recombine through deep-level impurities. An electron falls 
  into a "trap", an energy level within the bandgap caused by the presence of a foreign atom or a structural defect. The electron occupying the trap can in 
  a second step fall into an empty state in the valence band, thereby completing the recombination process. One can envision this process either as a 
  two-step transition of an electron from the conduction band to the valence band or also as the annihilation of the electron and the hole which meet each other in the trap.
  The energy liberated during the recombination event is dissipated by lattice vibrations or
  phonons. Its counterpart is thermal electron-hole pairs generation
  
  ∗ Auger recombination: an electron and a hole recombine in a band-to-band transition,
  but the resulting energy is absorbed by a third carrier (another electron or hole). Its
  counterpart is the impact ionization.
  
  Usually, a recombination event needs a third partner to allow conservation of energy and crys-
  tal momentum. This third partner is often a lattice defect, most commonly an impurity atom,
  with an energy state deep in the band gap, i.e. not close to the band edge. Recombination is
  then determined by these deep states or deep levels (cf. [18]).


On this dark noise, some cross-talk is observed :
photons emitted by the pixel "fired" may migrate to other pixels and trigger avalanches (cf. §4.1
and §4.3.4). We calibrate on this dark noise.

  The probability that an afterpulse occurs increases with the amount of charge that flows through the diode during a Geiger
  discharge. Thus, the afterpulsing probability increases with increasing bias voltage.
 %introduction sentence for SiPM : 
  
 
  accurate  description  of  this effects :
  
    When a pixel is red by either an incoming photon or by a thermally generated electron-
  hole pair, hot carriers in the avalanche breakdown induce emission of IR photons [2{4] thatSiPM
  in turn may trigger further avalanches in nearby pixels.  This stochastic process,  called
  optical  cross-talk,  is  characterized  by  being  nearly  instantaneous,  and  its  probability  is
  proportional to the SiPM gain. Operating at low bias voltage would diminish signicatively
  cross-talk  eects,  but  at  the  expense  of  degrading  the  photon-detection  eciency.   The
  incorporation  of  isolation  trenches  around  each  pixel,  as  proposed  by  [5],  successfully
  reduces optical cross-talk [6{8].  This technique has become very usual in the fabrication
  of this kind of photodetectors.  However, it was rst shown in [9] that a very signicant
  contribution to cross-talk can come from light re
  ected on the bottom surface of the Si
  bulk, and thus, trenches would not be able to completely prevent it.
  The  main  eect  of  cross-talk  is  to  introduce  a  multiplication  noise,  although  it  does
  not aect the pulse-height resolution.  So, at conditions where only one pixel is expected
  to be excited simultaneously (e.g.,  dark counts),  cross-talk results in output pulses with
  amplitudes twice or several times the amplitude of a single triggered pixel.  The cross-talk
  probability
  "
  is usually dened as the rate of dark counts with cross-talk (two or more red
  pixels) divided by the total dark-count rate

  assuming that cross-talk only takes place between adjacent pixels

  including light propa-
  gation through the silicon bulk and re
  ections on the bottom surface, have demonstrated
  that cross-talk can also be induced in distant pixels, which is supported by experimental
  data for these SiPMs

  An analytical formulation is desirable for a better understanding of cross-talk eects

 \paragraph{After-Pulses}
  
  another issue: carriers trapped during the avalanche discharge and then released trigger a new avalanche during a period of several 100 ns after 
  the breakdown. After pulse increase with the biais volatage. 

  This array could resume why we have choosen Hammatsu \footnote{Appendix 2 gives a large comparaison between differents constructors.}
  
\paragraph{other point of view  on three issues}

  dark noise : 
  \\
  The main source of noise limiting the SiPM performances is the dark noise rate, which mainly originates from the carriers created thermally in the 
  depletion layer.
  
  Each electron-hole recombination mechanism can be reverse leading to a carrier generation. Recombination holds when excess carriers decay. 
  Generation takes place when there is a paucity of carriers. We can distinguish three ways of recombination.

  Usually, a recombination event needs a third partner to allow conservation of energy and crys-
  tal momentum. This third partner is often a lattice defect, most commonly an impurity atom,
  with an energy state deep in the band gap, i.e. not close to the band edge. Recombination is
  then determined by these deep states or deep levels (cf. [18]).
  
  about after-pulse : Trapping phenomena - Afterpulsing

  Traps may result from the damage caused by an implantation in the fabrication process.
  Deep levels trap some avalanche carriers and release them with a statistical delay. If the
  delay is greater than the dead time after the previous avalanche pulse, a released carrier can
  re-trigger an avalanche and cause a statistically correlated pulse. 
  These carriers, captured by trapping centers inside the depletion layer and released after the diode has been recharged,
  form the afterpulse. 
  
  During an avalanche, only a very small fraction of the trapping level is filled : therefore, the trap population is always well below saturation and 
  the carrier trapping probability remains constant during all the avalanche pulse. 
  
  The probability that an afterpulse occurs increases with the amount of charge that flows through the diode during a Geiger
  discharge. Thus, the afterpulsing probability increases with increasing bias voltage.
  
  about CT : 
  Hot carriers in avalanche p-n junction emit photons even in the visible range. Thus, during
the avalanche breakdown, a photodiode operating in Geiger mode may emit a few photons.
The physical origin of this radiation is still a debated issue [19]. The photons emitted will be
detected by neighboring pixels.
  
  
  From the critical value of the electric field ( corresponding to the breakdown voltage applied on the SiPM), a self propagating chain reaction occurs. 
  In principle, an exponentially growing number of avalanches could be created. As the quenching takes place to a partic-
ular level, i.e. when almost the same number of avalanches has been created, all pulses have the same
amplitude, regardless of the number of original ion pairs that initiated the process.
  
  The drift speed of these electron/holes depends on the electric field strenght. 
  
  Attention : the electric field is increased to a certain level, the carriers are more likely to collide with the crystal lattice so that 
  their drift speed becomes saturated at an average speed. This phenomenon begins to occur when the electric field is in the vicinity of
  10 V/cm, and the saturated drift speed at this point is about
10 7 cm/s. 
If the reverse volatge increase even further, some of the carriers which escaped collision with the crystal lattice will have a great deal of
energy. When these carriers collide wih the crystal lattice, ionization in wich electron-hole pairs are newly generated takes place. 
These electron-hole pairs then create additioal electron-hole pairs in a process just like a chain reaction. This is a phenomenon referred to as 
avalanche multilplication of photocurrent. this phenomenon begins to take place when the electric field strength reaches 2*105 V/cm .

  Unfortunately,their  photon-counting  ability  is  seriously  limited  by  optical  cross-talk,  which affects  the

  This section could remind the reader how a SiPM works. 
  
  1) principe of avalanche multiplication 
  
  When light enters a photodiode, electron-hole pairs are generated if the light energy is higher than the band gap energy.
  Light energy E (eV) and wavelength λ (nm) have a particular relation : 
  
  λ = 1240/E (nm). 
  
  At room temperature the band gap of the Si is 1.12 ev. (graph band GAP vs temp in footnote).

  When electron-hole pairs are generated in the depletion layer (here p-) of the photodiode with a reverse voltage
  applied to the PN junction , the electron drift towards the N++ side while the holes drift towards the p++ side due to the electric field d
  developed across the pn junction. 
  
  the drift speed of these electron-pairs/carrier depends on the electric field strenght. (which is in our case)
  
  Attention : the electric field is increased to a certain level, the carriers are more likely to collide with the crystal lattice so that 
  their drift speed becomes saturated at an average speed. This phenomenon begins to occur when the electric field is in the vicinity of
  10 V/cm, and the saturated drift speed at this point is about
10 7 cm/s. 
If the reverse volatge increase even further, some of the carriers which escaped collision with the crystal lattice will have a great deal of
energy. When these carriers collide wih the crystal lattice, ionization in wich electron-hole pairs are newly generated takes place. 
These electron-hole pairs then create additioal electron-hole pairs in a process just like a chain reaction. This is a phenomenon referred to as 
avalanche multilplication of photocurrent. this phenomenon begins to take place when the electric field strength reaches 2*105 V/cm .

  the number of elc-hle pairs generated during the time that the carriers travel a given distance is reffered to as the ionization rate. 
  let to determine the avalanche multiplication mechanism. The ratio between alpĥa and beta indicate the device noise. 

  The APD dark current is categorized into: surface leakage current Ids flowing through the interface between the PN junction
  and Si oxide layer and internal current Idg generated inside the Si substrate. 
  The surface leak current is not multiplied because it does not
flow in the avalanche region, but the internally generated cur-

  The junction is carefully doped in order to have an avalanche BD (not Zener) only in the central active area of the pixel, used for the photon detection

  In this
condition, if no carrier is present in the depletion region, the
junction is highly sensitive to the detection of single photons.
In fact, if the photon is absorbed by creating an electron–hole
(e–h) pair, both carriers will start to drift in the high-field region
of the depletion layer, and being the voltage above BD, this drift
will result with a 100% probability in the impact generation of
a second e–h pair,and so on, up to the buildup of the junction 
avalanche.
